# Repository Structure for Hosting HTML Articles

This repository is designed for hosting and managing HTML articles. Below you will find a detailed explanation of the repository structure, how to view published articles, and instructions for adding future articles.

## Repository Structure

- `articles/`
  - This directory contains all the HTML articles.
  - Each article should be named with a unique identifier, e.g. `article-001.html`, `article-002.html`, etc.
  - Subdirectories may be created if articles are grouped by topic or date.

- `assets/`
  - This folder holds any assets related to the articles, such as images, stylesheets, and scripts.

- `index.html`
  - The main entry point of the repository, which links to all published articles.
  - This file is automatically generated when new articles are added.

## Viewing Published Articles

To view the published articles, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. You can also directly access each article by navigating to `http://<your-domain>/articles/article-001.html` (replace `<your-domain>` with the relevant domain or server path).

## Adding Future Articles

To add a new article to the repository, follow these steps:
1. Create a new HTML file in the `articles/` directory. Name it according to the unique identifier format.
2. Write your content in the HTML file and ensure it adheres to the standards of other articles in the repository.
3. Update the `index.html` file to include a link to your new article. Ensure that the link contains the correct path to your article file.
4. Commit your changes and push them to the remote repository.
5. Your article will be live and accessible through the published links.
